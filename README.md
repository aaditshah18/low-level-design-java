# Low-Level Design in Java ‚òï

üëã **Welcome to the Low-Level Design (LLD) in Java Repository!**

This repository is a curated collection of projects designed to showcase the practical application of software design principles and patterns using Java. Whether you're a student, a developer looking to sharpen your skills, or an enthusiast of clean code, you'll find valuable examples here.

Our goal is to build a living library of well-structured, easy-to-understand, and robust software solutions that stand as a testament to quality engineering.

## ‚ú® Core Philosophy

Every project in this repository is crafted with a strong emphasis on the following principles, ensuring that the code is not just functional, but also scalable, maintainable, and a pleasure to read.

*   **SOLID Principles:** We rigorously adhere to the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design to create flexible and decoupled systems.
*   **Clean Coding:** We believe that code is read more often than it is written. Expect to see meaningful naming, clear method signatures, and a consistent, readable style.
*   **Design Patterns:** Each project serves as a practical demonstration of one or more design patterns, solving common problems with elegant, reusable solutions.

## üöÄ Projects Showcase

Here's a glimpse into the projects you can explore. Each one is contained in its own directory and includes a detailed `README.md` with UML diagrams, design choices, and setup instructions.

| üè• **[Notification System](./projects/notification-system)**         | A patient monitoring system that tracks vital signs and dispatches alerts to healthcare staff through various channels. It's a great example of building a reactive and extensible system.             | `Observer`, `Strategy`, `Factory`, `SOLID`                      |
| üí∏ **[Splitwise](./projects/splitwise)**                             | A command-line expense-sharing application that allows users to split bills in various ways (equally, by exact amounts, or by percentage). It showcases how to model complex business logic cleanly. | `Factory`, `Strategy`, `SOLID`                                  |

## üå± A Look Ahead

This repository is a work in progress! üìà I am  continuously working on adding more projects that explore a wider range of design patterns and architectural challenges. Stay tuned for more examples and feel free to check back for updates.

Happy coding! üòä
